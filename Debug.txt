After I cloned the file over I ran the SetTester.java.

Bug 1
New Empty Set is failing the is empty. I did not get a line number to see what was giving it an error but I noticed that it is passing in other tests. I went to inspect the isEmpty method.
I set a breakpoint at line 34 and run in debugger. i noticed that at line 34 it is returning that rear is initialized as 0. when it got to the isEmpty it was returning false. 
I corrected the code to read rear == 0. isEmpty should be returning true if ==0.
Reran the tester and thee "New empty set" is passing entirely.
Realised this is not the correct answer to the code and it was causing the rest of it to fail. Made sure that 

Bug 2
I noticed that the add(A) scenario is failing the isEmpty, test size and contains A. my first thought is that it is not removing it correctly or something so i went to investigate the remove() method.
I set the break point at the while loop at line 64.
