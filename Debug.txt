After I cloned the file over I ran the SetTester.java.

Bug 1
New Empty Set is failing the isEmpty. I did not get a line number to see what was giving it an error but I noticed that it is passing in other tests. I went to inspect the isEmpty method.
I set a breakpoint at line 67 in the tester and ran in debugger. I noticed that at line 34 it is returning that rear is initialized as 0. when it got to the isEmpty it was returning false. 
I corrected the code to read rear == 0. isEmpty should be returning true if ==0.
Reran the tester and thee "New empty set" is passing entirely.
Realised this is not the correct answer to the code. Tried changing things around.
Realised it is indeed the correct answer and it fixerd the Empty Set is passing entirely.

Bug 2
I noticed that the Add(A) scenario is failing the isEmpty, test size and a few others.
Went to investigate the add method. I set a breakpoint at the tester in line 82. Ran the debugger and stepped through the code and watched
what was happening. noticed that the rear was not being updated after adding the new part. went back to the code and added rear++.
Passing almost everything except for the out of bounds.

Bug 3
Only thing left failing was the index out of bounds that was popping in A_addB_AB_testRemoveA and A_addB_AB_testRemoveB.
went and checked the remove method at those lines in the stack as a starting point. set a breakpoint at line 265 in the method. Ran in debugger and
saw that it was not shifting correctly. changed the while loop to be rear - 1 instead to move it the correct direction to not go out of bounds.
